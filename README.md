These are some of my professional projects I've worked on.  

Time Study Pages, Back Office Modules, Donor Questionnaire are builds that are part of a website/database.  A lost of back end coding was used to make these tools work.

Math Vs Monsters was a product of a company I had started to build an educational math app.  The app is no longer on the Apple app store but it can be tested here.
